Database Course – Final Project Assignment
Objective
The objective of this project is to consolidate and apply the theoretical and practical knowledge
acquired throughout the course. Students are expected to design, implement, and demonstrate a
complete database solution using Oracle SQL*Plus.

Project Scope
Each group of two students is required to:

   1. Select a real-world business or organizational domain for their database system (e.g.,
      hospital management, university registration, e-commerce platform, library system, etc.).
   2. Design an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that captures all relevant entities, attributes,
      and relationships.
   3. Map the ER diagram into a relational schema (relational database model).
   4. Implement the relational database in Oracle SQL*Plus.
   5. Populate the database with sufficient sample data (minimum 5 records per table).
   6. Develop and test SQL retrieval queries to generate key business reports.
   7. Present their project in a professional 10-minute presentation at the end of the semester.

Detailed Requirements
1. Database System Selection

      Choose a project topic/domain that requires the use of a database system.
      Get the topic approved by the instructor no later than 18/5/2025

2. ER Diagram Design

      Create a complete ER diagram showing:
          o All entities and their attributes.
          o Primary keys and foreign keys.
          o All types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
          o Cardinality and participation constraints.

3. Mapping to Relational Model

      Transform the ER model into a normalized relational database schema.
      Define tables, primary keys, and foreign keys accurately.
      Resolve many-to-many relationships properly.
4. Database Creation

      Create tables in Oracle SQL*Plus using DDL (Data Definition Language).
      Insert sample data into all tables using DML (Data Manipulation Language).
      Ensure data integrity and relational consistency.

5. Data Retrieval and Reporting

      Create and execute at least five meaningful SQL queries.
      Each query should demonstrate key retrieval concepts such as:
          o Joins between tables.
          o Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.).
          o Grouping and ordering of results.
          o Subqueries where appropriate.
      The queries should generate reports relevant to the selected domain (e.g., monthly sales
       report, overdue books list, patient appointments schedule, etc.).

6. Final Presentation

      Each group will have 10 minutes to present:
          o Project overview and selected domain.
          o ER diagram explanation.
          o Relational schema description.
          o Live demonstration of the created database, sample data, and reports.
          o Challenges faced and lessons learned.
      Presentations must be professional and well-structured.

Submission Deliverables
      ER Diagram (soft copy and printed).
      Relational schema mapping documentation.
      Oracle SQL*Plus script files:
          o DDL scripts for table creation.
          o DML scripts for data insertion.
          o SQL scripts for report queries.
      Final Report (Word/PDF file) summarizing:
          o Project description and objectives.
          o Design decisions and justification.
          o Screenshots of database and query results.
      Presentation slides (PowerPoint format).

Important Notes
      Deadline for final submission: 14/6/2024.
      Presentation dates:.
     Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Each group must submit original work.
     Late submissions will be penalized as per the course policy.
